```markdown
This document provides an extended overview of the \"Houkai no Kyoukai Sen\" project.

The structure, themes and lore elements of this world are based on a 2082 futuristic Tokyo clashed with disruption.

This file is used as an outlined clarification developers guideline.

```

## Repository Structure

- `README.md``: Project introduction, concept overview
- `docs/`: Lore elements and concepts will be placed here
- `src/`: Source code in NeXus or other language
- `configs/`: System and application configs

## Lore Terminology

The world is stratified by the weakening of the boundary line. Two dimensions, exchanged with vibrating energy, are in a state of flux. 

This enables exceptional feats like digital-link traversal patterns and internally consistent environments.

```mermaid

The gathering reality is that every Etorange (overcrossing person with 'Ebilities') defines their own definition of the borders between worlds.

```

## Project Usage Ideas

- Document trees could be navigated via contents/knowledge/

- Code, plan, etc. could be nested under `src/`

- Separate configs could be under `configs/`
